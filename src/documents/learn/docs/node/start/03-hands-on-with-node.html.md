Wednesday, October 31st from 6:30 - 8.00 pm

Node.js is an exciting new platform for building web applications in JavaScript. With its unique I/O model, it excels at the sort of scalable and real-time situations we are increasingly demanding of our servers. The ability to use JavaScript for both the client and server opens up many possibilities for code sharing, expertise reuse, and rapid development. The class is intended for anyone looking to explore the capabilities of the Node.js development platform.
At the end of the class, students will have gained a grasp on node's ecosystem and paradigms, be able to write node modules that they can publish and share, and will have experimented with writing realtime web applications.

## Level Pre-Requisites
- Can write basic JavaScript code (script tags, functions, variables, HTML manipulation)
- Can write HTML and CSS - Understands form submission (client and server relationship)

## Required class materials / software
- Bring a laptop (any operating system that has a command line and a web browser is fine - e.g. Mac OSX, Windows, and Ubuntu)
- Have your system's build dependencies installed, as well as git and node v0.8. Need help? Here's a guide: http://bevry.me/docs/installnode
