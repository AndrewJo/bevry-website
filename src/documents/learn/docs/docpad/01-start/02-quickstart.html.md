title: "Quick Start"

Once you've installed, you can get started with a brand new spunky functional website in a matter of minutes, by simply creating a new directory for your website, and then running `docpad run` inside it, like so:

``` bash
mkdir my-new-website
cd my-new-website
docpad run
```

This will create your website, watch for changes, and launch the DocPad server. It will ask you if you would like to base your website from an [already existing one](/docs/docpad/skeletons) to get started even quicker.

Once done, simply go to [http://localhost:9778/](http://localhost:9778/) to view your new website :) or when your website uses a different port, go to the url that `docpad run` mentions.
